### Hi there. I'm Abdurrahman ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about FPGA and DSP based digital signal processing. Develop and design real-time control algorithm and RTL modules for high speed digital design are my main interests. 

**abdurrahmansozuer/AbdurrahmanSozuer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on digital control algorithms used in power electronics devices
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux application in Vitis high level synthesis
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGA and TI DSPs based embedded software development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/abdurrahmansozuer
